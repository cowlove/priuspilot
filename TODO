TODO - fix FrameCaptureJNI interface to support multiple cameras/instances of interface. 


07/13/11  Just finished switching to HP 360p HD camera.  Works really well, 
	barely holds 30FPS, need the following failures
	
20110713.121415.yuv last part BTLN, L line failure, follows concrete sealant, 
	needs canny threshold of 9-10
20110713.121836.yuv BTLS, per van drifts left
FIXED 20110713.122308.yuv Entire BTLN, failed lane switches at -skip 3200	test case 
20110712.204053.yuv NB I405 dusk, faint line problem, needs low canny threshold of 5-6
20110713.204833.yuv  I90 WB at dusk, faint lane problem, needs low canny of 5-6

Autotune canny parameters - possibly offline heuristic.  Does 10 give a lock?  use it. 
Otherwise, use 5.   When using 5, periodically try 10, see if gives same lock.  If so, 
revert to 10. 




Toe-in

Look at hough stuff, see why isn't more precise, investigate parameters, see
if 75x75 field is really necessary

Understand why targetfinder line correlation doesn't properly compute the 
proper radius/angle step interval.  Now hardcoded to someting fixed

Investigate why hand-calculated frame size scaling factors didn't work, and 
why had to re-tune the perspective PID controllers. 

Finish automatic day/night mode switching.  Possibly need to use manual brightness
adjustment. 

There still are some squirrely lines that show up in the hough perspective VP 
grid.  Investigate. 


* TODO - test case /host/lanedumps/20110710.194915.yuv grabs asphalt sealant line instead of left lane line    

		l /host/lanedumps/20110710.194915.yuv -nodrop -jni -displayratio 1 -debug 0 -skip 4000 
	IDEAS - expand check for proper luminance pixel next to canny pixel to check for a certain number
	of pixesl, enforcing a minimum lane line width requirement. 

	Seems to need a lineluminancedelta of about 55, but then is very flakey
	
	idea- transform on the hough space, multiply each bucket by the value of its constant offset neighbor, with
	constant offsets chosen so that the two sides of a lane line are the only thing that correlate. 
		

* TODO prepare for double cameras

* Make protocol to arduino more robust.  Right now a readSerialInt failure returns zero, so any serial gibberish containing a "s" gives full left control input.  Idea- checksum

* Todo- Log cruise control inputs and outputs to log file 

* Similar thing for line, move line in to the innermost line over a high percentage threshold
of the global max score

* In TFRed and others, keep a large search area, but make separate and tighter constraints on the center
  of the target- must be closer to the center of the search area?

* Ideas for better result filtering in TFRed - for each red blob, select based on horizontal/vertical internal symmetry, 
  height-width ratio constraints, then apply symmetry test to pairs of blobs rather than the entire rectangle image. 
  Finally, enforce much closer constraints to vehicle centerline. 
  
    
* In TF line, do color filtering as discussed in papers

* Investigate the smallest reasonable joystick pulse that can be used to spoof cruise control inputs

* For detecting a loss of lock in TD tracking:
	- look at a narrow y range constrait, 
  	-  or enforce x/y/z correlation
  	- Look at variance of matched image, rather than the variance of the pixel error values
  
* In TD, make sure the variance value being used as a quality indicator 
  is variance of the test target, not variance of the match error.  I suspect
  it's the latter 

* In TD, introduce getImageByte abstraction to replace direct pic[], access
  in preparation of yuyv image formats

* Clean out FrameProcessor - create PidStatusDisplay, CruiseControl, KeyboardInterface,
  move command formatting into SerialBusInterface.setSteer(), setCruise(), setTorqueLimit()
  
* Clean out PidControl, remove second parameters, etc.  

* Clean out/remove LaneAnalyzer

* Pull out common TF/TD parameters into a class so that it can be selected by the configuration interface in the same
 	manner as PID-  suggestions - canny parameters, gaussian smooth parameters, color filter parameters HSL hi/lo,
 	hough transform angle/radius constraints, nonmax suppression parameters, maybe a generic threshold or percentage or
 	two?  
 	
* Pulldown configuration parameter list in the GUI

* TODO for Morning of 4/11  
	-  NOT DONE make display ratio a fps figure
		
*  Took data on apparent nonlinear gain of system
