FIXED - Investigated why HP3110 webcam seemed not to work on the latop.  Upgrading to kernel 3.6.3-030603-generic seemed to fix it fine. 

Cleaned up the jar archive location, moved it to ~/pplib and ~/mbrola, changed scripts accordinly

Need to document grub2 install problems with the imbedded pp machine- there was some reason why
update-grub did not work, but I can't quite remember what it was now.
